# Gas-Sensor
This is about simulations for detecting toxic gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and ammonia in dry and wet conditions at high and low temperatures.

# Note
1. Make Differential Equations look at PDB.m file
2. Find new parameters with running SEf2.m file
3. The result of new parameters will compile again in 2 times
4. Run the final simulation PDT.m and SA.m file
